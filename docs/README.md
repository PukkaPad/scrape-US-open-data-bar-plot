# Data scraping and visualization

A short Python project for extracting data from a public US web page by separating the data from the HTML. The data was passed to a database table (SQLite3) using list comprehensions.
The database was accessed using pandas and then I generated bar plots from a subset of the data.

The objective of this project was to learn how to create my database and to start familiarizing myself with Matplotlib library as well as to have a frist contact with Pandas library.

See the Usage section for more information.
